<h1>Searching Graphite</h1><br>

 The search box may contain multiple search strings separated by spaces. To match your search, a graphite name must match <b>all</b> of the search strings you provide. For example,<br>

<pre>
lfs busy
</pre>
<br>

Will only match names that contain the word "lfs" <b>and</b> the word "busy".<br>

Advanced users may note that every search string can be a regular expression.
