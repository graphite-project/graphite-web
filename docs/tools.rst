Tools That Work With Graphite
=============================


Collection
----------

`Brubeck`_
  A statsd-compatible stats aggregator written in C.

`Bucky`_
  A small service implemented in Python for collecting and translating metrics for Graphite. It can currently collect metric data from CollectD daemons and from StatsD clients.

`Carbonator Windows Service <https://github.com/CryptonZylog/carbonator>`_
  Simple lightweight Windows Service that collects Performance Counter metrics and sends them over to the Graphite server. Configured via .NET xml application configuration.

`collectd`_
  A daemon which collects system performance statistics periodically and provides mechanisms to store the values in a variety of ways, including RRD. To send collectd metrics into carbon/graphite, use collectd's write-graphite_ plugin (available as of 5.1). Other options include:

  - Jordan Sissel's node collectd-to-graphite_ proxy
  - Joe Miller's perl collectd-graphite_ plugin
  - Gregory Szorc's python collectd-carbon_ plugin
  - Paul J. Davis's `Bucky`_ service

  Graphite can also read directly from `collectd`_'s RRD files. RRD files can simply be added to ``STORAGE_DIR/rrd`` (as long as directory names and files do not contain any ``.`` characters). For example, collectd's ``host.name/load/load.rrd`` can be symlinked to ``rrd/collectd/host_name/load/load.rrd`` to graph ``collectd.host_name.load.load.{short,mid,long}term``.

`Collectl`_
  A collection tool for system metrics that can be run both interactively and as a daemon and has support for collecting from a broad set of subsystems. Collectl includes a Graphite interface which allows data to easily be fed to Graphite for storage.

`Diamond`_
  a Python daemon that collects system metrics and publishes them to Graphite. It is capable of collecting cpu, memory, network, I/O, load and disk metrics. Additionally, it features an API for implementing custom collectors for gathering metrics from almost any source.

`Ganglia`_
  A scalable distributed monitoring system for high-performance computing systems such as clusters and Grids. It collects system performance metrics and stores them in RRD, but now there is an `add-on <https://github.com/ganglia/ganglia_contrib/tree/master/graphite_integration/>`_ that allows Ganglia to send metrics directly to Graphite. Further integration work is underway.

`graphite-pollers <https://github.com/phreakocious/graphite-pollers>`_
  A collection of scripts that shovel data into Graphite including a multi-threaded SNMP poller for network interface IF-MIB statistics and another which pulls linux network stack data from files in /proc/net. Add to cron and go.

`Graphite PowerShell Functions <https://github.com/MattHodge/Graphite-PowerShell-Functions>`_ 
  A group of functions that can be used to collect Windows Performance Counters and send them over to the Graphite server. The main function can be run as a Windows service, and everything is configurable via an XML file.
  
`HoardD`_
  A Node.js app written in CoffeeScript to send data from servers to Graphite, much like collectd does, but aimed at being easier to expand and with less footprint. It comes by default with basic collectors plus Redis and MySQL metrics, and can be expanded with Javascript or CoffeeScript.

`Host sFlow`_
  An open source implementation of the sFlow protocol (http://www.sflow.org), exporting a standard set of host cpu, memory, disk and network I/O metrics. The sflow2graphite utility converts sFlow to Graphite's plaintext protocol, allowing Graphite to receive sFlow metrics.

`jmx2graphite`_
  The easiest way to poll JMX metrics and write them to Graphite. This tool runs as a Docker container, polling your JMX every X seconds and writing the metrics to Graphite. Requires a minimum of configuration to get started.

`jmxtrans`_
  A powerful tool that performs JMX queries to collect metrics from Java applications. It is requires very little configuration and is capable of sending metric data to several backend applications, including Graphite.

`Logster`_
  A utility for reading log files and generating metrics in Graphite or Ganglia. It is ideal for visualizing trends of events that are occurring in your application/system/error logs. For example, you might use logster to graph the number of occurrences of HTTP response code that appears in your web server logs.

`metrics-sampler`_
  A java program which regularly queries metrics from a configured set of inputs, selects and renames them using regular expressions and sends them to a configured set of outputs. It supports JMX and JDBC as inputs and Graphite as output out of the box.

`Sensu`_
  A monitoring framework that can route metrics to Graphite. Servers subscribe to sets of checks, so getting metrics from a new server to Graphite is as simple as installing the Sensu client and subscribing.

`SqlToGraphite`_
  An agent for windows written in .net to collect metrics using plugins (WMI, SQL Server, Oracle) by polling an endpoint with a SQL query and pushing the results into graphite. It uses either a local or a centralised configuration over HTTP. 

`SSC Serv`_
  A Windows service (agent) which periodically publishes system metrics, for example CPU, memory and disk usage. It can store data in Graphite using a naming schema that's identical to that used by collectd.


Forwarding
----------

`Backstop`_
  A simple endpoint for submitting metrics to Graphite. It accepts JSON data via HTTP POST and proxies the data to one or more Carbon/Graphite listeners.

`carbon-c-relay`_
  Enhanced C implementation of Carbon relay, aggregator and rewriter.

`carbon-relay-ng`_
  Fast carbon relay+aggregator with admin interfaces for making changes online - production ready.

`Evenflow`_
  A simple service for submitting sFlow datagrams to Graphite. It accepts sFlow datagrams from multiple network devices and proxies the data to a Carbon listener. Currently only Generic Interface Counters are supported. All other message types are discarded.

`Graphite-Newrelic`_
  Get your graphite data into `New Relic`_ via a New Relic Platform plugin.

`Graphite-relay`_
  A fast Graphite relay written in Scala with the Netty framework.

`Graphios`_
  A small Python daemon to send Nagios performance data (perfdata) to Graphite.

`Graphout`_

`Grockets`_ 
  A node.js application which provides streaming JSON data over HTTP from Graphite.

`Gruffalo`_
  An asynchronous Netty based graphite proxy, for large scale installations. It protects Graphite from the herds of clients by minimizing context switches and interrupts; by batching and aggregating metrics. Gruffalo also allows you to replicate metrics between Graphite installations for DR scenarios, for example.

`Ledbetter`_
  A simple script for gathering Nagios problem statistics and submitting them to Graphite. It focuses on summary (overall, servicegroup and hostgroup) statistics and writes them to the nagios.problems metrics namespace within Graphite.

`pipe-to-graphite`_
  A small shell script that makes it easy to report the output of any other cli program to Graphite.

`statsd`_
  A simple daemon for easy stats aggregation, developed by the folks at Etsy. A list of forks and alternative implementations can be found at <http://joemiller.me/2011/09/21/list-of-statsd-server-implementations/>

Just like Ganglia, it uses a hierarchial structure: Environment/Cluster/Host/Metric to be able to display overview graphs and host-specific metrics. It communicates directly to the Graphite API to determine which Environments, Clusters, Hosts and Metrics are currently stored in Graphite.

`Graph-Explorer`_
  A graphite dashboard which uses plugins to add tags and metadata to metrics and a query language with lets you filter through them and compose/manipulate graphs on the fly. Also aims for high interactivity using `TimeseriesWidget`_ and minimal hassle to set up and get running.

  It hasn't any dependencies except `Tornado` package. Very light and really very easy deployed.

`graphite-to-zabbix`_
  A tool to make zabbix alerts based on Graphite data.

`rearview`_
  A real-time monitoring framework that sits on top of Graphite's time series data. This allows users to create monitors that both visualize and alert on data as it streams from Graphite. The monitors themselves are simple Ruby scripts which run in a sandbox to provide additional security. Monitors are also configured with a crontab compatible time specification used by the scheduler. Alerts can be sent via email, pagerduty, or campfire.

`Rocksteady`_
  A system that ties together Graphite, `RabbitMQ`_, and `Esper`_. Developed by AdMob (who was then bought by Google), this was released by Google as open source (http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2010/09/get-ready-to-rocksteady.html).
