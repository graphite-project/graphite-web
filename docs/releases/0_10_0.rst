0.10.0 -- UNDER DEVELOPMENT
===========================

.. add the release date below when making a release.

*no release date*

Changes
-------

* Metrics can be reordered via the composer.

* A WSGI file has been added to ``graphite-web``. This is especially useful for
  people running graphite-web with a standalone WSGI sever such as Gunicorn as
  they can directly run ``gunicorn graphite.wsgi`` instead of managing their own
  WSGI file.

* ``manage.py`` is no longer available. The alternative is to use the
  ``django-admin.py`` command provided by Django. ``python manage.py
  <command>`` can be replaced with ``django-admin.py <command>
  --settings=graphite.settings``.

* The metrics node in the graphite tree has been renamed from "Graphite" to
  "Metrics".

* Pluggable storage finders have been added. This allows graphite to fetch
  data from other datastores than Whisper or Ceres. See the :doc:`storage
  finder docs <../storage-backends>` for more information.

* Documentation and settings have been updated to use the up-to-date syntax
  for configuring graphite-web's SQL database. Check your config for
  ``DATABASE_*`` entries and update them to the new ``DATABASES`` syntax.

* The search index file is now generated with the ``build-index`` command that
  has been rewritten in Python. ``build-index.sh`` is still available but is
  just an alias to ``build-index``.

* `Tox`_ is now used for running the tests locally across the supported Django
  and Python versions combinations. A :doc:`section about working on
  graphite-web <../development>` has been added to the documentation.
