0.9.11
======
*8/20/2013*


**NOTE: Graphite 0.9.11 has a regression which breaks cache queries. Please use** :ref:`0.9.12 <0-9-12>` **instead**

Graphite 0.9.11 is now available for usage. Source bundles are available from GitHub:

* https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web/archive/0.9.11.tar.gz
* https://github.com/graphite-project/carbon/archive/0.9.11.tar.gz
* https://github.com/graphite-project/whisper/archive/0.9.11.tar.gz

Graphite can also be installed from `Pypi <http://pypi.python.org/>`_ via
`pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/index.html>`_. Pypi bundles are here:

* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/graphite-web/
* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/carbon/
* http://pypi.python.org/pypi/whisper/

Upgrading
---------
It's recommended to install all three 0.9.11 packages together for the most success, however in this
case *graphite-web* can be installed separately from carbon if necessary. *Carbon* and *Whisper* must
be updated together due to the coupling of certain changes.

Graphite 0.9.11 now requires a Django version of at least 1.3. Ensure this dependency is satisfied
before updating *graphite-web*

As always, comparing the example config files with existing ones is recommended to ensure
awareness of any new features.

Security Notes
--------------
This release contains several security fixes for cross-site scripting (XSS) as well as a fix for
a remote-execution exploit in graphite-web
(`CVE-2013-5903 <http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2013-5093>`_).
Patches for the past three prior releases are available in these gists:

* `0.9.10 <https://gist.github.com/mleinart/6285953>`_
* `0.9.9 <https://gist.github.com/mleinart/6285975>`_
* `0.9.8 <https://gist.github.com/mleinart/6285983>`_

In a pinch, the following url mapping can be removed by hand if the remote-rendering feature is
not being used::

    diff --git a/webapp/graphite/render/urls.py b/webapp/graphite/render/urls.py
    index a94a5d1..f934b43 100644

       ('~(?P<username>[^/]+)/(?P<graphName>[^/]+)/?','renderMyGraphView'),
       ('', 'renderView'),
     )


Finally, The setting of Django's SECRET\_KEY setting is now encouraged and exposed in local\_settings.py as
well.
