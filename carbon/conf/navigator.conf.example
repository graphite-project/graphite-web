# This configuration file controls the behavior of the Navigator UI, available
# at http://my-graphite-server/nav/.
#
# The navigator works only with metrics that fall into naming schemes
# defined in this file. This creates a simpler, more targetted view of the
# data. The general form for defining a naming scheme is as follows:
#
#[Metric Type]
#scheme = basis.path.<field1>.<field2>.<fieldN>.%
#field1.label = Foo
#field2.label = Bar
#
#
# Where each <field> will be displayed as a dropdown box
# in the UI and the % will be the portion of the namespace
# shown in the Metric Selector panel. The .label options set the labels
# displayed for each dropdown.
#
# For example:
#
#[Sales]
#scheme = sales.<channel>.<type>.<brand>.%
#channel.label = Channel
#type.label = Product Type
#brand.label = Brand
#
# This defines a 'Sales' metric type that uses 3 dropdowns in the Context Selector
# (the upper-left panel) while any deeper metrics (per-product counts or revenue, etc)
# will be available in the Metric Selector (upper-right panel).
